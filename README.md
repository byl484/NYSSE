# Assignment of the course Programming 3 Tampere University.
Contents of the Course repository were preamde by Tampere University course staff. Everything else excluding the map image were made by me and my friend Jere [jliima](https://github.com/jliima). Currently the contents of the Documentation repository are only in Finnish however the comments of the code are in English. The game is relatively straight forward so the manual is not necessary.
